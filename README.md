# manage_your_time
This repository includes .py script and an example .txt file to store the durations spent on your tasks. It allows you to see how much time you spent on each task, start stopwatch before you start working on a task, and enter time spent manually.

For the .txt file, the default separator is space (' '). You can change it in .py file, just pay attention to "split" method.
